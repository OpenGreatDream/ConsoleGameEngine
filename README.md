### What is ConsoleGameEngine(CGE)?

ConsoleGameEngine is a game engine for making text-based/pixel-based games in windows console, to a certain extent it was inspired by [olcConsoleGameEngine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/videos/blob/master/olcConsoleGameEngine.h).

CGE is written from scratch(still under development), Its goal is to provide rich graphics interface and support [3D games in Console](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/CommandLineFPS)

> IMPORTANT : ConsoleGameEngine's not a C# wrapper of olcConsoleGameEngine(Not compatible with olcCGE)
